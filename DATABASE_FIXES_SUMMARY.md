# Database Connection Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Connection Pool Configuration Issues**
- **Problem**: Tests were using `NullPool` which creates a new connection for every operation, causing connection exhaustion
- **Fix**: Changed sync engine to use `StaticPool` for better connection reuse while keeping `NullPool` for async engine to avoid event loop issues
- **Impact**: Reduced connection overhead and improved test performance

### 2. **Neon Database Compatibility Issues**
- **Problem**: Neon database pooler doesn't support `statement_timeout` in connection options
- **Fix**: Removed `statement_timeout` from connection args in test configuration
- **Impact**: Fixed connection failures with "unsupported startup parameter" errors

### 3. **Timeout Configuration Issues**
- **Problem**: pytest timeout was commented out, allowing tests to hang indefinitely
- **Fix**: Installed `pytest-timeout` plugin and enabled 300-second timeout
- **Impact**: Tests now timeout properly instead of hanging

### 4. **Production Database Pool Timeout**
- **Problem**: 10-second pool timeout was too aggressive for production loads
- **Fix**: Increased pool timeout from 10 to 30 seconds in production settings
- **Impact**: More stable database connections under load

### 5. **Test Database Connection Alignment**
- **Problem**: Test environment had different timeout settings than production
- **Fix**: Aligned test connection timeout with production settings (10 seconds)
- **Impact**: Better consistency between test and production environments

## Key Configuration Changes

### `/tests/conftest.py`
```python
# Before
poolclass=NullPool,  # Both sync and async
connect_args={
    "connect_timeout": 30,
    "options": "-c statement_timeout=30000"  # Unsupported by Neon
}

# After  
# Sync engine
poolclass=StaticPool,  # Better connection reuse
connect_args={
    "connect_timeout": 10,  # Align with production
    # Remove statement_timeout for Neon compatibility
}

# Async engine
poolclass=NullPool,  # Avoid event loop issues
connect_args={
    "server_settings": {
        "jit": "off",
        # Remove statement_timeout for Neon compatibility
    },
    "command_timeout": 10,
}
```

### `/pytest.ini`
```ini
# Before
# timeout = 300
# timeout_method = thread

# After
timeout = 300
timeout_method = thread
```

### `/database/db_setup.py`
```python
# Before
"pool_timeout": 10,  # Too aggressive

# After
"pool_timeout": 30,  # Better stability under load
```

## Test Results

### Before Fixes
- Multiple connection timeout errors
- Tests hanging indefinitely
- Connection pool exhaustion
- Neon compatibility issues

### After Fixes
- ✅ Database connection tests pass
- ✅ Authentication tests pass
- ✅ Basic functionality tests pass
- ✅ Proper timeout handling
- ✅ Neon database compatibility

## Verification

Run this to verify fixes:
```bash
python test_db_fixes.py
python -m pytest tests/test_auth_fix.py -v
```

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor Connection Pool Usage**: Use the `get_engine_info()` function to monitor pool health
2. **Consider SQLite for Unit Tests**: For faster test execution, consider using SQLite for tests that don't require PostgreSQL-specific features
3. **Test Parallelization**: Current setup may need adjustments for parallel test execution
4. **Connection Monitoring**: Add connection pool monitoring to detect issues early

## Next Steps

1. Run full test suite to identify remaining issues
2. Investigate AI service integration errors (separate from database issues)
3. Consider implementing connection retry logic for transient failures
4. Review test isolation to ensure proper cleanup between tests
