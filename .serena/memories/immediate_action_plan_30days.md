# RuleIQ Immediate Action Plan - Next 30 Days

## Week 1-2: Foundation Assessment & Design Finalization

### Codebase Audit for UK Requirements
- **Map existing ComplianceFramework model**: Check capabilities vs PRD needs
- **Verify Evidence.ai_metadata field**: Ensure structure supports new AI classifiers  
- **Review SmartEvidenceCollector logic**: Assess for UK compliance patterns
- **Security audit**: Current AWS setup readiness for eu-west-2 migration

### AI Integration Readiness
- **Test ComplianceAssistant**: Validate with policy generation prompts
- **Google Gemini API**: Confirm quotas and UK region availability
- **RAG pattern design**: UK regulatory knowledge base architecture
- **Vector database setup**: For regulatory control definitions

### Security Architecture Review
- **AWS migration plan**: eu-west-2 region transition strategy
- **KMS encryption**: Implementation plan for existing data
- **MFA integration**: Design with current auth system
- **Endpoint security**: Review for new AI services

## Week 3-4: Sprint 1 Preparation & Execution

### Framework Data Preparation
- **Source UK frameworks**: ISO27001, SOC2, GDPR, Cyber Essentials control mappings
- **Policy templates**: Create 20 UK-specific templates (prioritize top 5)
- **Schema design**: Framework version/region extensions
- **Data validation**: Compliance SME review of framework content

### AI Service Architecture
- **Policy generation endpoint**: Implement skeleton structure
- **Prompt templates**: Configure for UK compliance language
- **Testing framework**: AI output validation and quality scoring
- **Fallback systems**: Ensure graceful degradation

## Critical Path Dependencies

### Sprint 1 Blockers (Must Complete):
- [ ] UK compliance framework data sourced and structured
- [ ] AI service quotas confirmed and UK endpoints tested
- [ ] User role model design completed  
- [ ] Security review of new AI endpoints completed
- [ ] Legal review of policy generation approach

### Sprint 2 Blockers (Must Complete):
- [ ] Evidence AI classifier model selected and tested
- [ ] GitHub API integration architecture designed
- [ ] Audit logging decorator pattern implemented
- [ ] Vector database populated with control definitions
- [ ] Performance baseline established for AI operations

### Sprint 4 Blockers (Must Complete):
- [ ] Legal review of GDPR/PECR implementation approach
- [ ] Companies House API developer access secured
- [ ] PDF generation library integrated and tested
- [ ] Cookie consent legal requirements validated
- [ ] DPIA template content legally reviewed

## Resource Mobilization Plan

### Immediate Team Assignments:
1. **Backend Lead**: Framework model extensions, AI endpoint setup
2. **Frontend Lead**: Policy editor UI design, consent banner components
3. **ML Engineer**: Evidence classifier training data preparation
4. **DevOps**: AWS infrastructure migration planning
5. **Compliance SME**: UK framework content sourcing, legal requirements
6. **QA Engineer**: AI testing framework development

### External Dependencies Timeline:
- **Week 1**: Legal counsel engagement for GDPR/PECR review
- **Week 2**: Companies House API developer account application
- **Week 3**: External security firm engagement for pentest scheduling
- **Week 4**: UK pilot customer identification and initial contact

## Success Metrics (30-Day Checkpoint):
- [ ] All Sprint 1 blockers resolved
- [ ] Policy AI assistant delivering coherent draft suggestions
- [ ] User role system functional with permission enforcement
- [ ] UK framework data loaded and accessible via API
- [ ] Security architecture approved for EU data residency
- [ ] Sprint 2 dependencies 80% complete

## Risk Mitigation Actions:
1. **AI Quality**: Implement human review checkpoints for all AI outputs
2. **Timeline Pressure**: Identify P1 features that can be deferred to Phase 2
3. **External Dependencies**: Have backup plans for API access delays
4. **Resource Constraints**: Cross-train team members on critical components
5. **Legal Compliance**: Start legal reviews early to avoid last-minute blockers

## Next Milestone: Sprint 1 Completion (Sep 12, 2025)
**Target**: Functional UK framework library with AI-assisted policy generation and basic RBAC system operational in staging environment.
