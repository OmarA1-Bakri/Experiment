# RBAC Implementation Progress - Sprint 1 Final Task

## Completed Work
- **RBAC Database Schema**: Complete database models for roles, permissions, user roles, role permissions, framework access, and audit logging
- **RBAC Service Layer**: Full service implementation with role/permission management, framework access control, and audit logging
- **JWT Authentication Enhancement**: Extended JWT tokens with role claims, created UserWithRoles class with permission checking methods
- **RBAC Authentication Router**: New `/api/v1/auth/*` endpoints with role-based login, user info, admin role management
- **RBAC Middleware**: Comprehensive middleware for automatic API route protection based on permissions and HTTP methods
- **RBAC Configuration**: Centralized configuration system for route permissions, framework access rules, and security policies
- **RBAC Test Suite**: Complete test coverage for models, services, authentication, middleware, and integration flows

## Technical Implementation Details
- Database migrations applied successfully for RBAC schema
- Fixed foreign key relationship ambiguities in SQLAlchemy models
- Created dual authentication system (legacy + RBAC) for backward compatibility
- Implemented ownership-based access for business profiles
