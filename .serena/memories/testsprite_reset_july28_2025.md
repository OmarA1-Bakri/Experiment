# TestSprite Reset - July 28, 2025

## Actions Taken
- ✅ **Killed existing TestSprite processes**: Stopped all running TestSprite instances
- ✅ **Cleaned test results**: Removed `testsprite_tests/` directory for fresh start
- ✅ **Freed port 3000**: Ensured port is available for TestSprite testing
- ✅ **Started fresh TestSprite**: New TestSprite MCP server is now running on stdio

## Current Status
- **TestSprite Status**: Running and ready for test execution
- **Port 3000**: Available for TestSprite use
- **Previous Issues**: Authentication and React key errors from previous session (see `testsprite_session_july28_2025`)

## Next Steps
TestSprite is now ready to begin fresh test execution. The previous critical issues identified were:
1. Authentication token handling errors
2. React duplicate key errors in assessments
3. Missing grid.svg resource

Fresh testing should re-identify these issues for systematic resolution.
