### 2. CLI Interface (`sprint_cli.py`)
Interactive command-line interface with the following commands:
- `python sprint_cli.py status` - Current project status dashboard
- `python sprint_cli.py init-sprint` - Initialize new sprint (interactive/default)
- `python sprint_cli.py generate-stories` - Generate roadmap-based user stories
- `python sprint_cli.py analyze-stories` - Analyze risks and completeness
- `python sprint_cli.py decompose-stories` - Break down into implementation tasks
- `python sprint_cli.py track-progress` - Track sprint implementation progress

### 3. Test Suite (`tests/test_sprint_management.py`)
Comprehensive test coverage including:
- Sprint initialization and configuration
- Story generation and validation
- Analysis algorithms and risk detection
- Task decomposition logic
- Progress tracking calculations
- Business logic edge cases

### 4. Demo System (`demo_sprint_management.py`)
Complete demonstration showcasing:
- End-to-end sprint management workflow
- Real ruleIQ project context integration
- Progress tracking with mock data
- Recommendations engine
- Next sprint planning capabilities

## Current Sprint 2 Context

### Sprint 2 Goals
- **Name**: "Evidence Classification & Design System"
- **Duration**: August 1-15, 2025
- **Capacity**: 120 hours
- **Velocity Target**: 40 story points
- **Team**: Lead Developer, Frontend Developer, AI Engineer

### Generated User Stories (Based on Current Roadmap)

1. **STORY-001: Complete RBAC System Implementation** (CRITICAL)
   - 8 story points | 32 hours | Authentication & Authorization
   - Status: Sprint 1 carryover, nearly complete
   - Tasks: Database schema, service layer, middleware, admin UI, audit logs, tests

2. **STORY-002: Complete Teal Design System Migration** (HIGH)
   - 13 story points | 40 hours | Frontend Design System
   - Status: 65% complete, needs final implementation
   - Tasks: Tailwind config, Aceternity removal, feature flags, color migration, a11y testing

3. **STORY-003: AI Evidence Auto-Classification System** (HIGH)
   - 21 story points | 64 hours | Evidence Management
   - Status: Next priority after RBAC completion
   - Tasks: API design, document analysis, classification model, control mapping, UI

4. **STORY-004: Compliance Insights and Analytics Engine** (MEDIUM)
   - 13 story points | 40 hours | Analytics & Insights
   - Status: Foundation ready, can start in parallel
   - Tasks: Data model, scoring engine, gap analysis, dashboard, recommendations

5. **STORY-005: API Performance Optimization** (MEDIUM)
   - 8 story points | 24 hours | Infrastructure
   - Status: Ongoing maintenance task
   - Tasks: Query optimization, monitoring, alerts, load testing

### Analysis Results
- **Total**: 5 stories, 63 story points, 200 estimated hours
- **Risk**: Scope exceeds typical capacity - recommend prioritization
- **Priority**: 1 Critical, 2 High, 2 Medium
- **Feature Coverage**: Auth, Frontend, AI, Analytics, Infrastructure

## Integration with ruleIQ Project

### Aligns with Current Status
- **Project**: 98% production ready
- **Sprint 1**: 67% complete (ahead of schedule)
- **Completed**: UK Frameworks (100%), AI Policy Generation (100%)
- **In Progress**: RBAC System
- **Next**: Evidence Classification, Design System

### Technical Context Integration
- Uses actual ruleIQ architecture patterns
- Incorporates real performance requirements (<200ms API, 671+ tests)
- Aligns with security goals (8.5/10 score)
- Supports production timeline (December 1, 2025)

### Memory Integration
- Reads from `ALWAYS_READ_FIRST` for development protocols
- Integrates with `FRONTEND_CONDENSED_2025` for design system context
- Leverages `BACKEND_CONDENSED_2025` for technical requirements
- Updates sprint completion memories (`sprint_1_completion_status`)

## Usage Examples

### Quick Start
```bash
# Show current status
python sprint_cli.py status

# Initialize new sprint
python sprint_cli.py init-sprint --interactive

# Generate and analyze stories
python sprint_cli.py generate-stories
python sprint_cli.py analyze-stories

# Break down implementation
python sprint_cli.py decompose-stories --story-id STORY-001
```

### Demo Workflow
```bash
# Run complete demonstration
python demo_sprint_management.py
