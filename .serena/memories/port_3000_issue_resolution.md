# Port 3000 Issue Resolution - July 28, 2025

## Current Problem
- TestSprite requires frontend on port 3000
- Port 3000 shows "EADDRINUSE" error 
- Frontend is currently running on port 3001
- Need to free port 3000 and restart frontend there

## Actions Taken
1. Attempted to kill processes on port 3001
2. Tried to start frontend on port 3000 - got EADDRINUSE error
3. Unable to identify what's using port 3000 (lsof/netstat issues)

## Current Status
- Frontend running on port 3001 but TestSprite needs port 3000
- TestSprite tests all failing due to wrong port (trying localhost:3000)
- Need to resolve port conflict to proceed with validation

## Next Steps
1. Find alternative way to free port 3000
2. Or modify TestSprite configuration to use port 3001
3. Run TestSprite validation once port issue resolved
