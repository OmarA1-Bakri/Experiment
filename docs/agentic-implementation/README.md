## Key Concepts

### Trust Gradient System
- **Level 0 (Observational)**: Agent watches and learns patterns
- **Level 1 (Suggestive)**: Proactive recommendations with explanations  
- **Level 2 (Collaborative)**: Joint decision-making with agent insights
- **Level 3 (Autonomous)**: Independent action with notification/override

### Core Agents
1. **Framework Library Agent** - Intelligent compliance framework curation
2. **Business Profile Intelligence Agent** - Evolving business understanding
3. **Assessment Orchestration Agent** - Adaptive question flows
4. **AI Policy Generation Agent** - Collaborative policy crafting
5. **Evidence Intelligence Agent** - Smart evidence categorization
6. **Risk Analysis Agent** - Dynamic risk assessment

### Technical Stack
- **State Management**: LangGraph with PostgreSQL persistence
- **Agent Framework**: Pydantic AI with type-safe validation
- **Integration**: FastAPI backend with Next.js frontend
- **AI Models**: Google Gemini with multi-model strategy
