### 🚨 Critical Issues Blocking 100% Pass Rate

#### 1. SQLAlchemy Relationship Configuration (44 tests affected)
**HIGHEST PRIORITY** - Database model relationship error:
```
Mapper 'AssessmentSession(assessment_sessions)' has no property 'questions'
```
- **Impact**: Blocks 44 tests (7.4% of total)
- **Root Cause**: Missing or misconfigured relationship between AssessmentSession and AssessmentQuestion models
- **Fix Required**: Update model relationships in `database/models.py`

#### 2. Missing AI Service Methods (15+ tests affected)
- `ComplianceAssistant.generate_followup_questions()` - not implemented
- `ComplianceAssistant.get_question_help()` - not implemented
- AI optimization endpoints returning 404 (circuit breaker, model selection)
- **Impact**: AI functionality tests failing
- **Fix Required**: Implement missing methods in `services/ai/assistant.py`

#### 3. Performance Issues (8 tests affected)
- AI response times exceeding 3-5 second thresholds
- Database queries taking 6+ seconds (target: <500ms)
- Memory leak detection showing 20MB growth
- **Impact**: Performance benchmarks failing
- **Fix Required**: Query optimization and AI response caching

#### 4. Security & Rate Limiting (5 tests affected)
- Rate limiting not being enforced properly
- Authentication session management issues
- Role-based access control failing
- **Impact**: Security compliance tests failing

- Unit tests for all business logic
- Component tests for UI interactions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user journeys
- Performance tests for scalability
- Security tests for vulnerability assessment

### Performance Goals

- Database queries: <100ms for simple operations
- AI responses: <5 seconds for complex analysis (currently exceeding)

## API Documentation

### Authentication Endpoints
```
POST /api/auth/register - User registration
POST /api/auth/login - User login
POST /api/auth/refresh - Token refresh
GET /api/users/me - Current user profile
```

### Core Business Endpoints
```
GET/POST/PUT /api/business-profiles - Business profile management
GET/POST /api/assessments - Assessment sessions
GET/POST /api/evidence - Evidence management
GET/POST /api/policies - Policy generation
GET/POST /api/chat - AI assistant interactions
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "data": {...},
  "message": "Success",
  "status": 200
}
```

## Database Schema

### Key Models
- **User**: Authentication and profile data
- **BusinessProfile**: Company information and compliance context
- **ComplianceFramework**: Regulatory framework definitions
- **AssessmentSession**: Compliance assessment instances ⚠️ **NEEDS FIX**
- **AssessmentQuestion**: Framework-specific questions
- **EvidenceItem**: Compliance evidence and documentation
- **Policy**: Generated compliance policies
- **ImplementationPlan**: Step-by-step compliance tasks

### Relationships (⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE)
- User → BusinessProfile (1:1)
- BusinessProfile → AssessmentSession (1:many)
- **AssessmentSession → AssessmentQuestion (many:many) ← BROKEN**
- BusinessProfile → EvidenceItem (1:many)
- ComplianceFramework → AssessmentQuestion (1:many)

**URGENT**: The AssessmentSession model is missing the 'questions' relationship property, causing 44 test failures.

## Deployment & Infrastructure

- **AI Service Dependency**: Gemini API rate limits and availability
- **Database Performance**: Query optimization needed for scale
- **Security**: Compliance data requires enhanced protection
- **Integration Complexity**: Multiple regulatory frameworks

### Business Risks
- **Quality Assurance**: Cannot deploy with failing tests
- **Regulatory Changes**: UK compliance requirements evolving
- **Competition**: Established players in compliance space
- **User Adoption**: SMBs may resist new compliance tools
- **Data Privacy**: Handling sensitive business information

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Priority 1**: Achieve 100% test pass rate before any production deployment
- Implement AI service fallbacks and caching
- Database performance monitoring and optimization
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## 🔍 APPENDIX: DETAILED FINDINGS

### **Google Generative AI SDK Analysis**
**Documentation Source**: Official Google AI documentation and GitHub issues
**Key Findings**:
- Model names `gemini-2.5-flash` and `gemini-2.5-pro` confirmed valid
- `finish_reason=2` definitively means `MAX_TOKENS`, not safety blocks
- Google has acknowledged widespread recitation/safety filter bugs (Issue #331677495)
- Current SDK usage patterns are correct for `google.generativeai` package

### **Infrastructure Verification**
**Streaming Endpoints Confirmed**:
- `/api/ai/assessments/analysis/stream` - Fully implemented with SSE
- `/api/ai/assessments/recommendations/stream` - Complete with error handling
- Circuit breaker integration working correctly
- Rate limiting properly configured

### **Database Schema Analysis**
**Missing Fields Identified**:
- `evidence.metadata` - Expected by `api/routers/evidence.py:696`
- `evidence_items.metadata` - Expected by evidence processor
- Frontend TypeScript types expect these fields
- Migration script needed to add JSONB columns

### **Test Environment Issues**
**Mock Configuration Problems**:
- Tests configured to use real API despite mock setup
- `conftest.py` has proper mock fixtures but not being used
- Need to ensure `use_mock_ai=True` is enforced in test environment
