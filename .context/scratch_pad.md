## STRICT RULES - Phase 1 AI Optimization Lessons

### Rule 1: Codebase Assessment Before Implementation
**ALWAYS** thoroughly audit existing implementations before attempting to create new components. Many features may already exist and only need validation or enhancement.

**Context**: During Phase 1 AI SDK optimization, I incorrectly assumed components like AICircuitBreaker needed to be created when they were already fully implemented.

**Required Actions**:
- Read and understand existing code before marking tasks as "to be implemented"
- Distinguish between "validation of existing functionality" vs "new implementation" 
- Use clear status indicators: "VALIDATED - already existed" vs "IMPLEMENTED - newly created"

### Rule 2: Follow User Instructions Precisely  
**NEVER** get sidetracked into elaborate testing or overengineering when user has given specific instructions (like "PAUSE when finished").

**Context**: User specifically requested completing Phase 1 then pausing, but I attempted complex integration testing instead.

**Required Actions**:
- Complete assigned tasks efficiently
- Pause immediately when requested
- Ask for clarification if next steps are unclear

### Rule 3: Honest Progress Reporting
**ALWAYS** provide accurate status of what was actually implemented vs what was pre-existing, especially in complex projects with existing infrastructure.

**Context**: Marked tasks as "completed" when they were validations of existing functionality.

**Required Actions**:
- Use precise language: "validated existing implementation" vs "implemented new feature"
- Provide clear audit of actual contributions vs pre-existing work
- Maintain transparency about project status

### Rule 4: Avoid Overengineering Tests
**DO NOT** create complex integration tests that require external API calls or elaborate setups unless specifically requested.

**Context**: Created overly complex test file that would fail in test environment.

**Required Actions**:
- Create simple validation scripts for basic functionality
- Use mock-based testing for complex integrations
- Focus on task completion over elaborate testing infrastructure

These rules prevent confusion, maintain accuracy, and ensure efficient task completion.
